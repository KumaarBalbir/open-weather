# Overview

This is a simple weather application named open-weather, designed to display current weather information for a city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It includes a simple and user-friendly interface with a search bar where users can enter a city name to retrieve weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon representing the current weather conditions. The background color of the app changes dynamically based on the weather conditions (cloudy, clear, rainy, drizzle, mist).
